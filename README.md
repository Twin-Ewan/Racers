## *Backstory*

The version first of this game was made in my free time on a old version of scratch installed on the school computers I got the idea for the game in a book after a while in my games dev class I need a game to make for my SCQF level 5 so I decided to reuse the game for that (mid late '19 - early mid '21) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/505855396/.

After a very turbulent start of not even having a game engine for months we were tasked once more to make another game so I started work on a 3d remake of the game there was one problem though, the engine the substitute teacher couldn't do 3D but thankfully after another 1.5 months~ I got to test out a better engine for the class Godot and it was leagues better so I continued on and started work on making the game, thankfully I used the small break to make the assets for the game on a online free editor 'figuro.io' so as you can expect they weren’t very good another problem also a raised; it was due sooner than I thought so by November I had to unforently abandon that project and had to quickly think of something else to make so I decided once more to do a port of the game to Godot thankfully as I had already made the game I already at the assets and the ones I couldn't reuse I’d remake so after 1-2 months of relaxed work it was done and thankfully up to spec as I was able to get Level 6 certificate by May
