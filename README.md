The version first of this game was made in my free time on a old version of scratch installed on the school computers i got the idea for the game in a book after a while in my games dev class i need a game to make for my SCQF level 5 so i decided to reuse the game for that (mid late '19 - early mid '21)

After a very turblent start of not even having a game engine for months we were tasked once more to make another game so i started work on a 3d remake of the game there was one problem though, the engine the substitute teacher couldn't do 3D but thankfully after another 1.5 months~ i got to test out a better engine for the class Godot and it was leagues better so i contuined on and started work on making the game, thankfully i used the small break to make the assets for the game on a online free editor 'figuro.io' so as you can expect they were'nt very good another problem also a rised; it was due sooner than i thought so by November i had to unforently abadon that project and had to quickly think of something else to make so i decided once more to do a port of the game to Godot thankfully as i had already made the game i already at the assest and the ones i couldn't reuse i'd remake so after 1-2 months of relaxed work it was done and thankfully up to spec as i was able to get Level 6 certificate by May
